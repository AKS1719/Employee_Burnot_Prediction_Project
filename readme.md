# Employee Burnout Prediction Project

## Overview

Employee burnout is a state of physical, emotional, and mental exhaustion caused by excessive and prolonged stress. It can lead to decreased productivity, job performance, and overall well-being. Organizations must identify early signs of burnout in today's fast-paced, demanding work environments to address and prevent it proactively. Predicting employee burnout enables organizations to take measures to mitigate its effects and foster a healthier, more productive workforce.

This project aims to predict employee burnout using machine learning regression techniques. By analyzing various factors such as workload, mental fatigue, job role, and work-life balance, we can develop a predictive model to identify employees at risk of burnout. This can help organizations design interventions that promote employee well-being and enhance productivity.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is called "Are Your Employees Burning Out?" It contains a set of features related to employee demographics, work conditions, and mental health. The dataset includes the following 9 columns:

- **Employee ID:** A unique identifier for each employee (e.g., fffe390032003000)
- **Date of Joining:** The date the employee joined the organization (e.g., 2008-12-30)
- **Gender:** The employee's gender (Male/Female)
- **Company Type:** The type of company the employee works for (Service/Product)
- **WFH Setup Available:** Indicates whether the employee has a work-from-home facility (Yes/No)
- **Designation:** The employee's designation within the organization, ranging from 0.0 to 5.0 (higher values indicate higher designations)
- **Resource Allocation:** The number of work resources allocated to the employee, ranging from 1.0 to 10.0 (higher values indicate more resources or work hours)
- **Mental Fatigue Score:** The level of mental fatigue experienced by the employee, ranging from 0.0 to 10.0 (higher values indicate higher fatigue levels)
- **Burn Rate:** The burn rate is the target variable that represents the employee's burnout level, ranging from 0.0 to 1.0 (higher values indicate higher burnout)

## Project Goals

1. **Understand Factors Influencing Burnout:** Analyze the dataset to uncover key factors contributing to employee burnout. 
2. **Develop Predictive Models:** Use regression techniques to build a predictive model capable of identifying employees who may be at risk of burnout.
3. **Provide Actionable Insights:** Generate insights that can help organizations implement preventive measures, reduce burnout, and enhance employee well-being.

## Workflow

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- **Data Cleaning:** Handle missing values, duplicates, and erroneous entries.
- **Feature Engineering:** Transform categorical variables into numerical formats (e.g., gender, WFH setup).
- **Normalization:** Scale features like resource allocation and mental fatigue score for better model performance.
  
### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Correlation Analysis:** Identify relationships between features and the burn rate.
- **Visualization:** Use plots like histograms, box plots, and scatter plots to visualize the distribution of data and key trends.

### 3. Model Development
- **Train-Test Split:** Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
- **Regression Models:** Implement multiple regression techniques such as:
  - Linear Regression
  - Random Forest Regressor
  - Gradient Boosting Regressor
  - Decision Tree Regressor
- **Model Evaluation:** Use metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared to evaluate the models.

### 4. Model Optimization
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Use techniques like GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV to fine-tune model hyperparameters.
- **Cross-Validation:** Perform k-fold cross-validation to ensure model stability and robustness.

### 5. Deployment
- Once an optimal model is achieved, the next step involves deploying it via an API to provide real-time burnout predictions for new employee data.

## Key Features of the Model

- **Burn Rate Prediction:** Predict the likelihood of employee burnout based on input features such as resource allocation, mental fatigue score, and company type.
- **Interpretable Results:** Feature importance analysis to understand which variables have the most impact on burnout.
- **Real-time Prediction:** Deploy the model to a web or mobile interface for real-time predictions.

## Conclusion

This project serves as a practical application of data science to address a real-world problemâ€”employee burnout. By predicting burnout, organizations can take proactive measures to improve employee well-being, enhance productivity, and create a healthier workplace.
